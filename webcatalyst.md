Recreate the layout vibe of https://do-undo.com/?ref=onepagelove as a one-page website for a studio called “Web Catalyst” (we build websites for clients). Use a clean, minimal aesthetic inspired by the reference, but with original code and assets (no text, images, or fonts copied from the source).

Requirements:
- Tech: React + Tailwind CSS. Responsive from mobile up. Fast, accessible (WCAG AA), SEO-friendly (semantic tags, meta/OG tags), and lightweight animations.
- Branding: Simple, modern look. Neutral light theme, radk colours just like in the reference, generous white space, clear grids, subtle hover states.
- Header: Logo with text reading "Web Catalyst" on the rop left (use "web_catalyst_logo_copy.png");  right side: “Get in touch” button that opens mailto:contact.webcatalyst@gmail.com (retain this CTA throughout).
- Hero (above the fold):
  - Smaller headline than the reference (visually prominent but not oversized).
  - Headline: “Websites that launch faster and convert better.”
  - Subheadline: “We design, build, and ship high-performing sites for ambitious brands.”
  - Primary CTA: “Get in touch” → mailto:contact.webcatalyst@gmail.com
- Services strip (replacing the “Strategy / Naming / …” line):
  - Single multi-line sentence that speaks to web work, separated by slashes:
    “Discovery / UX & UI Design / Web Development / CMS Setup / Performance & SEO / Analytics / Launch & Hosting / Iteration”
- Capabilities section (short bullets):
  - “Design to build in weeks, not months”
  - “Clean, maintainable code”
  - “On-page SEO & analytics by default”
  - “Friendly CMS or no-CMS options”
- Portfolio section (where the reference shows example work):
  - Title: “Recent Work”
  - Grid of 9 project cards (image, title, one-line result, and link button). Use placeholder images and these example links (use target=_blank):

  
    1) https://www.oversour.studio
    2) https://ludovicroth.com
    3) https://www.folllit.com
    4) https://www.guillaumenicollet.com
    5) https://militosautorepair.com
    6) https://www.nelsonsrepair.com
    7) https://www.yurasroofing.com
    8) https://www.oharasson.com
    9) https://foodfindershub.org/


  - Each card should feel like a polished case tile with a subtle hover effect.
- Testimonial band (optional filler copy): a short, single-line testimonial with a small avatar placeholder.
- Contact footer:
  - Headline: “Let’s build your website”
  - Button: “Get in touch” → mailto:contact.webcatalyst@gmail.com
  - Plain email text link below the button for redundancy.
- Footer microcopy: © Web Catalyst. Replace all placeholder assets easily.

General notes:
- Do not copy any text, images, or fonts from the reference; generate original content.
- Keep typography sizes tasteful; the hero headline must be clearly smaller than the reference.
- Keep the sticky/visible “Get in touch” CTA consistent (header, hero, and footer).
